seq-www
=======

Toy instruments that use the web audio API. 

seq-www includes a drum machine, a poly synth and a mono bassline generator. It is done entirely using the web audio API's oscillators, filters, and noise. There are no samples.

Please feel free to do whatever you want with this code, though it is governed by an MIT style license that you can find in the accompanying LICENSE file.

seq-www uses https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob for dial rendering. Please consult the relevant license information there as well.

Here are some useful resources for understanding the web audio API and the style of synthesis that I tried to do here:
